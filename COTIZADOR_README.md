## How to Test

1. Navigate to `/cotizador/nueva` to test the enhanced form
2. The form should load within a few seconds
3. Test the following workflows:
   - Selecting clients from the dropdown
   - Adding project details and team information
   - Selecting materials using the searchable comboboxes for all material types
   - Adding products manually
   - Adding products from inventory
   - Checking price calculations
   - Submitting the form (simulation)
4. If any errors occur, the error boundary should catch them and display a user-friendly message
